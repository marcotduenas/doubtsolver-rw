# doubtsolver-rw
This project is a rewritten version of this older project "[Sistema de d√∫vidas](https://github.com/marcotduenas/sistema-de-duvidas)".

This application was initially developed for private study. Someday, it became the main idea of one of the three projects
I've worked on during my high school at SENAC Sorocaba, after talking with the teacher responsible for the project, it 
became clear that this software could be used in a way to help the students to solve their doubts.

For the students, they have to fill out a form with their name, wich study area the doubt belongs to and the doubt itself.
